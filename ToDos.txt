don't conflate route with flight.
define route as journey between origin and destination

generate txt file with flights
read flightList from file, rather than generating every time
once read, report total routes, total flights per route



search a flight, find lowest price
find all routes between A and B with a stop in C
find all routes between A and B with a stop in C and D
search a route with the shortest duration (including layover time)

instead of hashmap for flight index, try a graph, weighted by price 

a route between origin and destination could be through any number of nodes.
a graph of these routes could be weighted by price.
1) JFK to ATL (2 hours, $200), ATL to DEN (3 hours, $300), DEN to SEA (2 hours, $150)   Total $650, 7 hours + stops
2) JFK to SEA (5 hours, $700)                                                           Total $700, 5 hours
3) JFK to IAH (3 hours, $200), IAH to SEA (3 hours, $200)                               Total $400, 6 hours + stops

traverse the graph to find the fastest route
traverse the graph to find the cheapest route
traverse the graph to find the route with fewest stops
